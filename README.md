This is a Python application for generating random passwords. It is different from other password generators because it allows you to specify the length of the password, and then generates a random password of that length. If you don't like the password, you can simply press the "Generate" button again to generate a new one.

This application is useful for creating strong and secure passwords for your online accounts. It is also useful for creating passwords that are easy to remember, but still difficult to guess.

To use the Password Generator Application Application, simply clone the repository and run the main.py file in Pycharm or VsCode. Simply enter the desired length of the password in the "Length" field and press the "Generate" button. The application will then generate a random password of that length. If you don't like the password, you can simply press the "Generate" button again to generate a new one.

You can also copy the generated password to your clipboard by clicking on the "Copy" button. This makes it easy to paste the password into your online account or other application.
